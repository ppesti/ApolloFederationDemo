**ApolloFederationDemo**

This demo project demonstrates the use of Apollo's products to create GraphQL solutions.
Apollo Federation is used to create a federated architecture instead of a monolithic graph.

This demo project only serves as an example and does not provide a step-by-step guide on recreating such applications using tools like Rover Cli.

Here are some useful resources where you can learn about all Apollo Products and GraphQL concepts:
